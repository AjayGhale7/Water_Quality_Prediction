# Water_Quality_Prediction
This project predicts the potability of water based on parameters like pH, Turbidity, TDS, and Temperature using machine learning algorithms. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Kaggle Water Potability Dataset to classify water samples as safe or unsafe for drinking.
